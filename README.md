# War-Thunder-IRL
This program retrieves data from your war thunder client and displays them fysically in real life!

# Prerequisites
## Hardware
 - Arduino uno 
    - Other arduino compatable boards will probably work too, may need some tinkering in the code for using the correct pins.
 - Jumper wires
 - Servo(s)
 
 ## Mentality
  - This is my first open source project, so please be kind. ðŸ˜Š
 
# Installation
## Step 1: Making sure the api works
Start a test flight in war thunder and start flying.
Open this url in the browser: http://127.0.0.1:8111/. If a page pops up with info, HURRAY! else....

Try
 - Start war thunder
 - Open settings
 - find something like "Enable Api"

## Step 2: install Visual studio (for if you want to modify the source code)
If you have not installed visual studio yet, install from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
Make sure that in the installer you select ".NET desktop development" for installment.

When installed open the solution by double clicking on "WarThunderScraper.sln" in the "War_Thunder_Scraper" folder. 

## Step 3: Edit / upload arduino code
### Option 1: using VSC (Recommended)
If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the extention "platform.io". Using this extention you can instantly
 upload the code to the arduino(Default set do arduino uno, change this in file "platformio.ini" if neccecery).
 [More info](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#quick-start)
  
### Option 2: using Arduino ide
If you don't want to use the platform.io extention you can resort to using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
You will need to change the folder structure of the source. Basically move all items from the lib to the src folder, rename all files that end
in .cpp to .ino and open this folder in the IDE. Some tinkering to make this work may be needed.

## Step 4: Setting up hardware.
*Example tutorial coming soon (Hopefully...)*

For my own version I 3d printed [this speedometer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3745020) 

# Usage
Once you opened the solution in VS, press f5 to start the application. Select the com port you think your arduino is connected to. 
Start a flight and start the application
